# What is Mockchain?

Mockchain is a terminal based, menu-driven program written in Rust that allows you to create a basic blockchain simuilation environment.
Some of the core concepts of blockchain technology are covered including:

 - Mining blocks to add to the chain
 - Generating tokens
 - Creating transactions between accounts
 - Wallet creation
 - Public key crytography and hashing
 - Digital signing of transaction hashes
 - Chain verfication

# What is the purpose of Mockchain?

It provides a simple options menu with clear outputs to explain what is happening when you perform an action e.g create a new wallet or add a new transaction.
This tool is educational, exposes all data to the user so they can see what is going on, and uses JSON data files for persistance and object representation.
